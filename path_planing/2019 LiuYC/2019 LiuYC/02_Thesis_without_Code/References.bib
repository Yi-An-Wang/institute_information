abstract = "Bringing about desirable collisions (making interceptions) and avoiding unwanted collisions are critically important sensorimotor skills, which appear to require us to estimate the time remaining before collision occurs (time-to-collision). Until recently the theoretical approach to understanding time-to-collision estimation has been dominated by the tau-hypothesis, which has its origins in J.J. Gibson’s ecological approach to perception. The hypothesis proposes that a quantity (tau), present in the visual stimulus, provides the necessary time-to-collision information. Empirical results and formal analyses have now accumulated to demonstrate conclusively that the tau-hypothesis is false. This article describes an alternative approach that is based on recent data showing that the information used in judging time-to-collision is task- and situation-dependent, is of many different origins (of which tau is just one) and is influenced by the information-processing constraints of the nervous system."

    abstract = { The relation between car-following behaviour and braking performance was studied in a driving simulator. The theoretical perspective was that individual differences in tactical car-driving behaviour may be related to skills on the operational level of the driving task via a process of adaptation. In a sample of 16 young and middle-aged experienced drivers independent assessments were made of preferred time headway during car following and of braking skill. Starting from modern theories of visual-motor learning, braking performance was analyzed in terms of a reaction time component, an open-loop visual-motor component, and a closed-loop visual-motor component involving the precise adjustment of braking (timing and force) to the situation. The efficiency of the visual-motor component of braking was a strong and significant predictor of choice of time headway to the lead vehicle in such a way that less efficient braking indicated a preference for a longer time headway. This result supports the theory of adaptation on the individual level. }

    abstract = { Previous studies on the visual origin of time-to-collision (Tc) information have demonstrated that Tc estimates can be based solely on the processing of target expansion rate (optic variable τ). But in the simulated situations used (film clips), there was little reliable information on speed (owing to reduced peripheral vision) and distance (owing to the absence of binocular distance cues) available. In order to determine whether these kinds of information are also taken into account, it is necessary to take an approach where the subject receives a more complete visual input. Thus, an experiment conducted on a circuit under actual driving conditions is reported. Experienced drivers and beginners, who were passengers in a car, had to indicate the moment they expected a collision with a stationary obstacle to take place. Subjects were blindfolded after a viewing time of 3 s. The conditions for speed evaluation (normal versus restricted visual field) and distance evaluation (binocular versus monocular vision) by subjects were varied. The approach speed (30 and 90 km h−1) and actual Tc (3 and 6 s) were also varied. The results show that accuracy of Tc estimation increased with (i) normal visual field, (ii) binocular vision, (iii) higher speeds, and (iv) driving experience. These findings have been interpreted as indicating that both speed and distance information are taken into account in Tc estimation. They suggest furthermore that these two kinds of information may be used differently depending on the skill level of the subject. The results are discussed in terms of the complementarity of the various potentially usable visual means of obtaining Tc information. }

abstract = "The use of driving simulation for vehicle design and driver perception studies is expanding rapidly. This is largely because simulation saves engineering time and costs, and can be used for studies of road and traffic safety. How applicable driving simulation is to the real world is unclear however, because analyses of perceptual criteria carried out in driving simulation experiments are controversial. On the one hand, recent data suggest that, in driving simulators with a large field of view, longitudinal speed can be estimated correctly from visual information. On the other hand, recent psychophysical studies have revealed an unexpectedly important contribution of vestibular cues in distance perception and steering, prompting a re-evaluation of the role of visuo–vestibular interaction in driving simulation studies."

abstract="This paper considers the problem of autonomous robot navigation in dynamic and congested environments. The predictive navigation paradigm is proposed where probabilistic planning is integrated with obstacle avoidance along with future motion prediction of humans and/or other obstacles. Predictive navigation is performed in a global manner with the use of a hierarchical Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that can be solved on-line at each time step and provides the actual actions the robot performs. Obstacle avoidance is performed within the predictive navigation model with a novel approach by deciding paths to the goal position that are not obstructed by other moving objects movement with the use of future motion prediction and by enabling the robot to increase or decrease its speed of movement or by performing detours. The robot is able to decide which obstacle avoidance behavior is optimal in each case within the unified navigation model employed.",
